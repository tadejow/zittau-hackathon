                This is the ML model that leverages different NLP techniques in order to diagnose the problems and provide 
                the optimization strategies for your text in a selected SEO scenario. 
        
                ##### Purpose 
                One of our first goals was to classify given textual metadata of some website within the context 
                of some specific keyphrase. As a result of this demand we have created the tool able to encode and evaluate 
                quality of object associated with some textual information (e.g. webpage and it's main content, title, 
                headers, meta data, etc.). 
        
                ##### Future goals 
                Once we have established the model, that is able to tell the user if his/her content is well 
                written, we want to push it even further. Since optimizing content is very time and mind consuming process, 
                we want to generate already optimized pieces of content, that user can apply in his/her website, e.g. title, 
                h1s tags or even metadata!. """
